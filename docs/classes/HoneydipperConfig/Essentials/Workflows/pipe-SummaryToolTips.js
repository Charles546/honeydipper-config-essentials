Similar to the native `pipe` type workflow, it iterates through the the steps one at a time.&nbsp; Unlike the native `pipe` workflow, the named `pipe` workflow will stop when any of the steps return failure status in `.labels.status`. It also preserves the name of the step, if specified, in `.data.step` as an ouput value. This is useful when you have many steps for a workflow and don\'t want to check the status for each step.</div></div>"});
